# Catalog Service â€“ Addon Module

This Spring Boot microservice manages addons for the multi-tenant LMS platform. It provides REST endpoints to create, update, retrieve, list, and soft-delete addons. The service uses Postgres and Redis, integrated with shared-lib starters.

## Configuration

Ensure the following properties are set in `application.yml`:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://<host>:<port>/<db>
    username: ...
    password: ...
  jpa:
    hibernate:
      ddl-auto: validate
    show-sql: false
cache:
  type: redis
```

Caching uses Redis; configure `spring.cache.redis` properties accordingly.

If these values are absent or empty, the service defaults to an in-memory H2 database for local development.

## Running

```bash
mvn clean spring-boot:run -pl tenant-platform/catalog-service -am
```

The service will start on port 8080 by default. Use Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html` to explore APIs.

### Feature Guide

#### BaseCrudService

- **How to use:** Extend `BaseCrudService<T, ID, CreateDto, UpdateDto, ResDto>` and implement its abstract methods in your service implementation. Call `super.create(...)`, `super.update(...)`, etc., to leverage standardized CRUD logic.
- **When to use:** For any JPA-backed entity that requires basic create-read-update-delete semantics with soft-delete support.
- **Why to use:** It centralizes common logic (uniqueness checks, exception handling, mapping), reduces duplication, and enforces consistent API behavior across services.

#### AddonServiceImpl

- **How to use:** Inject `AddonService` in controllers and call its methods to manage addons. It automatically handles cache population/eviction.
- **When to use:** When implementing business logic specific to addons beyond the base CRUD operations (e.g., category-specific listing).
- **Why to use:** It inherits standardized CRUD behavior from the base service while adding addon-specific operations and caching.

## API Testing

Use Swagger UI or tools like Postman to exercise the endpoints.
