# API Gateway Configuration Modules

The gateway configuration is split into focused YAML modules that are imported via `spring.config.import`.
This keeps responsibilities clear and enables targeted overrides.

## File Overview

- `application.yml` – Core Spring Boot settings, shared pattern anchors, and encryption metadata.
- `gateway.yml` – Spring Cloud Gateway infrastructure defaults, cache and subscription behaviour, and administrative wiring.
- `routes.yml` – API version metadata; static service routes are provisioned via the database admin APIs.
- `security.yml` – OAuth2 resource server wiring, CORS policy, and centralised `permit-all` declarations.
- `tenant.yml` – Tenant resolution, correlation identifiers, and rate limiting configuration.
- `resilience.yml` – Reusable circuit breaker, retry, and bulkhead definitions for service integrations.
- `logging.yml` – Logging levels, management endpoint exposure, and telemetry exporters.

## Helm Packaging

The Helm chart under `charts/api-gateway` renders these modules into a ConfigMap.
Each document can be overridden through `values.yaml`, and secrets are referenced via `secretRefs`
so that credentials remain outside of version control. Optional Secret manifests can be generated by
populating the `secrets` map with `stringData` entries.
